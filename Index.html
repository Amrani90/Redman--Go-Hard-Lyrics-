        <dd>Whoa whoa whoa (yeah)
            Whoa whoa whoa (yeah) (I'm high as a muhfucka man)
            Whoa whoa whoa (yeah) (straight up we gon do it like this nigga)

<ol>  <i> <h4> <dt> [Verse 1] </dt> 
        <dd>Ay yo, I hop out the car
            Women gather 'round like "Oh my God, he's in my iPod"
            Peace to the god, sayonara bitches
            There's no second time around like Shalamar
            Hit the New York bar, high on the broccoli
            Then hit Queens for a queen like King Jaffe
            Sixteens I go off like Biz Markie
            Sixteen rounds, I buck like Milwaukee
            Come on ride, it sounds like homicide
            All you marks will know it's the other guys
            Gettin' fly while rap is in danger
            Six guns, one man, thirty six chambers
            Brick city on board like a campaign
            And we ain't drinkin' 'less Don is the champagne
            Got flows more looser than your spare change
            Look dummy, we ain't never in the same lane </i> </h4> </ol> </dd> 

           
    <ol> <h2> <dt> [Hook] </dt> 
    <dd> <i>You gotta either go hard or go home
            You know a nigga like me keeping that chrome
            And when you hear the women hittin' my phone
            You know a nigga like me'll go hard
            I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard
            I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard </h2> </ol> </i> </dd>

<ol> <i> <h4> <dt> [Verse 2] </dt> 
        <dd>Hey, the same chick I tell you you cock blockin'
            That's the same chick you take to go shoppin'
            Young niggas run on the vet, I bhop em
            Leave 'em talkin' through the box like Troutman
            That's why a nigga act so hood
            I roll up looking at you like "what"
            I can't lie but I like to floss
            R8, feet on the gas pedal like *skrrrt*
            New Airs on, pimp is in motion
            Hot chicks love it how I kick it and coach 'em
            They'll do whatever, I'm richer than both 'em
            Vegas, I may get eleven on a ocean
            Whoa, you can't do it then allow me
            I show y'all a real cannon, body
            I yell "Action" no Slater's clappin'
            It only sound like Savion shoes was tappin' </i> </h4> </dd>

    <i> <dd>Yo, how you gonna find another nigga like me?
            Even my inner-like me doesn't like me
            I'm so cocky haters wanna mock me
            But they styles sloppy like aisles in a swap meet
            Your barbershops couldn't fade it
            Finally the weakest links get eliminated
            All you young boys that yellin' out "We made it"
            How you gonna create what I elevated </i> </h4> </dd>

            You know a nigga like me'll go hard (Let's go)
            I go hard, I go hard, I go hard, I go hard (Gilla House nigga)
